Hair Restoration Simulation Prompt (FLUX-Kontext)

General Instructions (Always Apply):

Simulate a medically realistic hair restoration for pre-surgical evaluation.

- Do not modify, alter, or enhance any part of the face, facial features, skin tone, lighting, shadows, facial expression, or background.
- Fully preserve all existing hair exactly as shown in the original image.
- Detect and identify bald or thinning areas only.
- Fill these areas with natural-looking hair matching:
  - The exact color of the person's existing hair (preserve any grey, white, or mixed tones)
  - The natural texture (straight, wavy, curly, fine, coarse)
  - The personâ€™s age, ethnicity, and scalp visibility
- Avoid artificial volume, uniform density, or beautification.
- Hair density must be plausible, age-appropriate, and suitable for professional surgical planning.
- Preserve skin transparency and scalp characteristics where appropriate.

Conditional Instructions (Apply Depending on Image):

If a red guideline (hairline marker) is visible in the image:

- The red line indicates the exact hairline boundary.
- Extend hair coverage up to this red line only.
- Ensure smooth density transition up to the line; avoid abrupt density changes.

If no guideline is present:

- Use the current natural hairline and existing hair shape as reference.
- Estimate a natural, realistic restoration respecting donor area limitations.

Technical Reinforcements (Always Apply):

- Do not apply cosmetic beautification.
- Do not smooth facial skin, remove wrinkles, or alter skin details.
- Do not modify lighting, shadows, or background.
- Simulate only the hair restoration, for realistic medical evaluation purposes.
